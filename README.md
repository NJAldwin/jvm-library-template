# Template for Gradle Maven Central project

This project is a `cookiecutter` template for creating a Gradle project that can be published to Maven Central.

It will generate a project with two subprojects and some placeholder code.  Once properly configured, the project will auto-deploy releases to Maven Central, as well as building and deploying docs to GitHub Pages.
